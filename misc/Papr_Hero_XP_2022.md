This doc briefly highlights how we will award XP to those who participated in Papr Hero. 
As a reminder, Papr Hero was a testnet competition to see who could accumulate the most phUSDC using the papr protocol on Goerli.

Our proposal is to award each participant in the competition `1 Community XP` and `1 Activity XP`. Additionally, we plan to award the winner of the competition 
a special bunny accessory for their community NFT.
