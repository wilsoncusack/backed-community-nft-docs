# Backed NFT Docs

The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see past versions on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts). In June 2022, a new Community NFT was created that tracks XP across three categories: Activity, Contributor, and Community, and awards them both automatically (via bots) and through a nomination process. This rubric outlines eligibility for XP rewards:

### XP Awarded via Nomination Form

Some XP require a nomination process, to limit bots or scams. Once you complete a task or do something noteworthy, nominate yourself (or others!) for XP using the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5jfpa7okOGHU6WgIhqCtg_ImndrivZtVq3-Vk5OBmhCeY-Q/viewform).

<div class="content-activity">

#### Activity XP Examples

Nominate yourself for XP for remarkable protocol usage for which there is no automated tracking, such as:

- First ever loan
- Loan with most buyouts
</div>

<div class="content-contributor">

#### Contributor XP

Nominate yourself for XP that help develop the protocol, such as:

- Functionality-breaking-bug reported
- Code reviews on Github
- Design assets used in production
- Smart contract auditing
</div>

<div class="content-community">

#### Community XP

Nominate yourself for XP that add your voice to the community, such as:

- Organize a meetup at a conference
- Quality memes
</div>

</div>

### Accessories

Accessories are an art layer added to the bunny, typically in the form of neckwear. They can be earned automatically by reaching certain XP counts, or be awarded via the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5jfpa7okOGHU6WgIhqCtg_ImndrivZtVq3-Vk5OBmhCeY-Q/viewform) for special activies or roles.
